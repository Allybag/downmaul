<h1>Tilapia</h1>
<p>A userspace TCP stack.</p>
<p>I will be mainly following along with this
<a href="https://www.saminiir.com/lets-code-tcp-ip-stack-1-ethernet-arp/">guide</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A tilapia is a kind of fish.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Tap Device</h2>
<p>We will be dealing with a TAP device, a simulated Layer 2 device.
When we create our device we are assigned a MAC address at random
by the operating system, but we can choose our own if we want to:
<code>ip link set address aa::bb::cc::dd::ee::ff Tilapia</code></p>
<p>This means we will be sending and receiving Ethernet frames.</p>
<h1>Tilapia</h1>
<p>The goal of this TCP stack are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement a subset of TCP successfully</li>
<li>Show what is going on behind the scenes</li>
</ul>
<p>We can toggle this behaviour on or off by sending a <strong>SIGUSR1</strong> signal.
We can also toggle disabling all outbound writes with a <em>SIGUSR2</em> signal.</p>
<p>To do this, just execute the following in a shell on the tilapia host:</p>
<p><code>kill -s SIGUSR1 $(pidof tilapia)</code></p>
<pre><code>if ((roll &gt; 1) &amp;&amp; (roll &lt; 6))
{
    probability = simulate(roll);
    chances += probability;
}
</code></pre>
